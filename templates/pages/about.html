        <h1>The Author: Phil Tittensor</h1>
        <p>Although I have been the author of numerous non-fiction articles, I have, for many years, wanted to write
          a work of
          fiction. This website is largely devoted to my first project, 'The Nubian Quest'. The book was inspired by
          a
          backpacking adventure in Egypt, married to an idea that had been in my subconscious for many years. The
          Nubian Quest
          page tells a little of the book's story, from conception to finished work. I hope it may provide some
          inspiration for
          those of us who are sure we have a book in us, but never seem to be able to commit the idea to paper (or a
          hard
          drive). My blog is intended to chart a contemporaneous voyage to what I hope will be my first fictional
          publication.
          I'm just at the start of that particular journey, which I'm sure will be laden with set backs before the
          book arrives
          in print or on your kindle! Self publishing or via a literary agent? Hmm, I wonder. Still, I digress, this
          is
          supposed to be the page that tells you about me, so here goes.</p>
        <p>I'd like to think I'm still a thirty-something, but sadly the calendar disagrees! I'm married to Sarah, a
          beautiful,
          intelligent and supportive girl (is that a pc term at forty?) who is my absolute rock. I have a son, James,
          who like
          most eleven year olds is interested in almost everything except what Dad is doing on the computer. He did
          'borrow' a
          few sentences of an early chapter for school homework once, so I guess that's a start. Despite the
          advancing years, I
          still try to play squash twice a week with a great bunch of lads, most of whom I've known for many years. I
          also live
          for travel - never happier than with a backpack and a vague idea of the eventual destination.</p>

        <h1>The Novel: Nubian Quest</h1>
        <p>The novel is what I would describe as a thinking manâ€™s sci-fi. It is set in modern-day Egypt, though the
          story harks
          back to the time of the Pharaohs. It is based on the story of Akhenaten and Nefertiti, parents of the child
          king
          Tutankhamen. Akhenaten ruled Egypt for a mere fourteen years. In that time, he transformed Egyptian society
          and
          beliefs. How he achieved that feat forms the basis of The Nubian Quest. Similar choices, if presented
          today, would
          have even more radical consequences. Without losing its dynamism, or slowing the action, The Nubian Quest
          poses a
          moral question for those of us who find ourselves living in a dangerously unpredictable world, early in the
          twenty-first century.</p>
